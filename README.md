# Fun_With_Images
Repository for my Fun_With_Images playground from the [Introduction to Swift Programming](https://www.coursera.org/learn/swift-programming/home/welcome) course offered by University of Toronto on Coursera.

I created this playground, Fun_With_Images, which includes the RGBAImage.swift source file and forest.png image to mirror the one shown during the video tutorial in Week 4: Image Processing in Swift - Introduction to Image Processing.

The forest.png file was created by taking a screen shot of the image in the tutorial video and then scaling it to the same 160 x 120 dimensions as used in the video. As a result, the image will be slightly different but should be sufficient for following along with the tutorial video.
